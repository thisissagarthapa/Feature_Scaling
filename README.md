# Feature Scaling and Selection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing feature scaling and selection techniques to improve the performance of machine learning models. Key steps include data preprocessing, handling missing values, applying Min-Max scaling, standardization, and selecting the top features based on model performance.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize features using Min-Max scaling and standardize features to improve model performance.
- **Feature Transformation**: Transform features to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Feature Selection**: Use `SequentialFeatureSelector` to select the top features based on the performance of a linear regression model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for linear regression, feature selection, and model validation.

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values
- Identify and handle missing values by filling them with appropriate statistics (mean, median) or by dropping rows/columns with excessive missing data.

### Dropping Unnecessary Columns
- Remove columns that do not contribute to the analysis or model performance to streamline the dataset.

## Feature Scaling

### Min-Max Scaling
- Transforms features to a range between 0 and 1, which is beneficial for models sensitive to feature magnitudes.

### Standardization
- Centers the feature values around the mean with a standard deviation of 1, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to model training.

## Feature Transformation
- **Polynomial Features**: Generates new features by combining existing ones to capture non-linear relationships.

## Feature Selection
- **Sequential Feature Selector**: Selects the top features based on their contribution to model performance using a linear regression model.
